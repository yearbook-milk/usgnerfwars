This is a Python library designed to interface with the turret servos
and the firing control relays on the USG Nerf Drone/Turret.

Which output pins correspond to the left pitch servo, right pitch servo, yaw servo,
rev relay and pusher relay are configurable.

This program however will not have control over the vehicle on which the turret is 
mounted (be it a drone, RC car or a static mount).
