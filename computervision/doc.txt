== SUBJECT DETECTORS ==<br>
<br>
These are algorithms that are supposed to take in the frame and mark out all potential targets. <br>
<br>
* <b>ct2r</b>: This one will detect any object that matches the color filters applied in the detection parameters/filterdata. For instance, using   ct2r and applying filter {"colormasks": ct2r.colorMasksGenerator("green")} will result in any green objects in frame to be marked as potential targets.<br>
<br>
  The available colors are: black white red green yellow light_blue orange dark_pink pink cyan dark_blue<br>
<br>
* <b>am2r</b>: This one will detect any 4x4 Aruco markers. <br>
<br>
<br>
== SUBJECT TRACKERS ==<br>
<br>
These are algorithms that are supposed to "lock onto" a target. Instead of marking out all potential targets, these algorithms will seek out THE object with a specific profile. For instance, if there are two green shirted people in frame, and you choose to lock onto one of them, a tracker will be used to track that person, and while that tracker is in use, the program will ignore the other person and track the selected one.<br>
<br>
* <b>cvbits_KCF</b>: This one uses the cv2 built in KCF tracking alg. to track a subject.<br>
* <b>cvbits_KCF_75P</b>: This one uses the cv2 built in KCF tracking alg. to track a subject, but will shrink the initial ROI to 75% of its size before tracking it, to reduce CPU load.<br>
<br>
* <b>amt</b>: This one will track an Aruco marker with a selected ID. For instance, if you have IDs 69 and 420 and in frame, and you lock onto the   person with a 69 Aruco marker on them, the tracker will ignore the other person and track the person with the Aruco marker with ID 69.<br>
